Windows 10 scripts and registry edits

"10 Settings.reg" is used to make my preferred changes to windows 10 after first installation. Please feel free to modify this for your own personal preferences.

"DisableTelemetryService.bat" is pretty self explanatory. This must be run as an Administrator and it disables the service that performs alot of the telemetry in Windows 10. This has also been backported to Windows 7-8.1 and Server 2008-2012R2.

"UninstallOneDrive.bat" is also quite self explanatory, this uninstalls the default OneDrive application should you not want to use it. This also must be run as an Administrator.
